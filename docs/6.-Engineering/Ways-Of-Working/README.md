# Ways of Working

While we encourage empowered self organizing teams, there are some default ways of working teams are expected to adopt. These can be broken down into 5 Pillars

 - Collaboration
 - Test First Delivery
 - Driving Delivery 
 - Champion Quality (TBD name)
 - Continuous Improvement

 The following will summarize the each Pillar represents and give non exhaustive list sharing examples of good practices for each pillar.

## Collaboration

Empowered self organizing teams are expected to be proactively in their collaboration. Sharing information widely and loudly. On the lookout for opportunities to code together and consequently share knowledge and gain fast feedback on work.  

- Don't defer communication until standup - [advice on how to do this]
- Be loudly blocked [give examples]
- [Cross team collaboration tips karen]
- Engineers should commit frequent small PR's
- [structured and descriptive commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).
- Use Pull Requests (branching strategy) 
- Knowledge Sharing
- Treat each other with Respect - Respect is key to building Trust and trust is essential to effective collaboration
- Assume noble intent.  - Misinterpretations & Misunderstandings happen, but most of the time people have good intentions. 
- Use tools that encourage you to be collaborative.
- Ask questions and participate in conversations
- Actively participate in Agile Ceremonies.

## Test First Delivery

When Teams are planning on how to deliver a BI the focus should be how you can test the system, rather than build the system. This may require investigations or asking for support outside your team.

 - TDD development
 - Automate all the things
 - Using 3A's as an opportunity to work out your test strategy.
 - Taking advantage of your Test Engineer to discover best practices around testing
 - Understand the importance of testing
 - Don’t put all the pressure of testing on one person – everyone is responsible for a good product

## Own Product Delivery

It's important to note that the Team owns Product delivery not your Stakeholders. This means being on top of their Roadmaps and ensuring that any preparatory work is done before without Stakeholder prompting.

- Maintain up-to-date roadmap and backlog
- Readying work 3A's
- Bring forward uncertainty
- Collaboration with Stakeholders to solidify understanding of requirements
- Prioritising workload and re-planning
- Suggest improvements that add value to Stakeholders
- Ask your PM questions
- Familiarise yourself with the stakeholders

##  Champion Quality 

Teams are expected to hold each other to account and champion quality. Rather than "because we've always done it this way" it's striving to solve problems using good engineering practices. Being brave, coming up with innovative radical solutions if necessary.

- Teams must apply good scouting practices to improve the quality of every codebase they work on.
- Choosing the correct technology to solve the problem, which doesn't always means our sting to our defaults.
- Using bug fixes/features to improve our code coverage and regression scenario coverage.
- Consider potential risks and mitigate where possible
- Think outside the box .... how can we improve quality if had no boundaries

## Continuous Improvement

Remember that team can't evolve if they aren't looking at way to continuously improve the team and the platform. This doesn't mean they'll always be successful - we can learn more from our failures than our successes as long as we're willing to be honest and self critical with each other.

 - Use retrospectives to critically analyzes how the team is working.
 - Give honest but conscientious feedback to each other.
 - Recognize technical debt, and make active plans to tackle it.
 - Recognize pain point and come up with active plans to resolve them (don't just leave it to the next sprint ceremony).
 - Lessons Learned Sessions
 - Keep learning, training, and sharing your knowledge
